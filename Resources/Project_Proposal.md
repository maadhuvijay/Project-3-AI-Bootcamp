## Project Proposal

### Project title: AI - Powered LEGO classifier

### Project Description: 

The AI-powered LEGO classifier will use a neural network model to classify the LEGO images into its corresponding design number.

### How does this solve the real world problem? What approach will you use?

Many households accumulate large collections of LEGO pieces that children lose interest in, while parents are unsure how to repurpose them. A model that identifies individual LEGO pieces and recommends sets that can be built using them provides a practical solution, making better use of existing LEGO collections.

Project 3 Scope:
1. Will use image classification model to classify the image and give the corresponding design number
2. Give details on the predicted design number. 

Future scope:
1. Recoginize the group of lego pieces from a photo and recommend sets that can be built using these pieces. 

### Datasets used
Kaggle dataset of lego images

### Breakdown of tasks
1. Lego classifier main code - model training and predictions. 
2. Gradio or an UI app that can upload a LEGO image and give the LEGO details.
3. Presentation slides
4. Readme update
5. Git hub - final code upload
6. Verify the project requirements
7. Demo code
